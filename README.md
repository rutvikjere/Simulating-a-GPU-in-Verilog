# Simulating-a-GPU-in-Verilog
This is my semester long project for the ECE5545 course. Will be adding the files as the weeks go by. The project involves creating an FSM with minimum 8 inputs and outputs and 32 states.
Using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave, I created several blocks that constitute a GPU using a behavioural model and applying appropriate test vectors. Modules include an ALU, memory/LSU, the core, fetch, decode, dispatch, scheduler, etc.
